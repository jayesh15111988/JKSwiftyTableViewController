# JKSwiftyTableViewController
A Sample project to demonstrate the use of table view controller in Swifty way with generics and structs

This project demonstartes how we can create a custom and reusable table view controller using structs, generics and support for undo and delete
operations for the list of items on tableView. This project is inspired by the [Chris Eidhof's talk at trySwift](https://realm.io/news/tryswift-chris-eidhof-table-view-controllers-swift/)

Though I took the liberty to update a little bit of code from the original source, it still shows the spirit of codebase that original author
has demonstarted in the talk. So sad that I could not imitate the flashy image pop out animation as shown in the talk. 

You can find detailed information about this implementation on either original source at [Chris Eidhof's talk at trySwift](https://realm.io/news/tryswift-chris-eidhof-table-view-controllers-swift/) or you can also check out my blog post at [Swifty UITableViewController with Generics and Structs](https://jayeshkawli.ghost.io/swifty-uitableviewcontroller-with-generics-and-structs/)
